# Production-Planing-ajusted-Capacity-RCCP-in-GAMS-SolverStudio
Algorithm developed in GAMS for the optimization of a Master Production Schedule adjusted to the capacity (RCCP-Rough Cut Capacity Planning) and added to Excel through the add-in SolverStudio

I am learning the use of this platform because I want to help me develop an algorithm in GAMS language and that I will run from SolverStudio
